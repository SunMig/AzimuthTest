# AzimuthTest
This android project implements the estimation of azimuth by using android underlying algorithm and Mahony algorithm.
It also provides the function of writting files which contains the data of azimuth to the storage of phone.
You can change some code that implements the sensor reponse event functions to collect the accelerometer data,
gyro data and magnetic field data.These data can also write to the storage of phone by change the writting function.
